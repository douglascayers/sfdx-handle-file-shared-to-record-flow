## Overview

This project is inspired by [Michelle Hansen](https://twitter.com/@mehansen82) who was seeking a way to
call a flow when a file is shared to a record.

As of the Summer '19 release, ContentDocumentLink, ContentDocument, and ContentVersion objects are
not supported in Process Builder to monitor for record changes. Please vote for [Terence Chiu's idea](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=0873A000000E35YQAS).

Not to be deterred, Michelle and I collaborated to develop an Apex trigger that could
know when a file was being shared to a record and then call an autolaunched flow
where the business logic could be implemented declaratively.

This project is the result of that awesome collaboration ðŸ™‚

## Getting Started

### Activate and Test the Flow

1. From Setup, activate the **Handle File Shared to Record Flow** flow you [deployed](#deploy-metadata-to-your-org) to your org.

2. Navigate to an account record and add a file to it, either through the Files related list or through a Chatter post.

3. Refresh the page and note that the flow posted a Chatter message, "A file has been shared to this record."

> Congratulations, it worked! Now it's time to customize the flow to suit your needs.

### Customize the Flow

1. From Setup, open the **Handle File Shared to Record Flow** flow.

2. Delete the **Post to Chatter** action, then add any of your own business logic.

3. Save the flow as a new version then activate the new version.

> Go forth and be awesome!
